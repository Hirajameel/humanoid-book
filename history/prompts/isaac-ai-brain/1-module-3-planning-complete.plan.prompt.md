# Module 3 Planning Complete - AI-Robot Brain

## Original Prompt

```
Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Purpose:
Plan Module 3 content in Docusaurus, focusing on conceptual understanding of AI perception, navigation, and training with NVIDIA Isaac. Minimal illustrative code only, theory-only navigation.

Chapters:

1. Isaac Sim Overview
   - Photorealistic simulation
   - Synthetic data generation
   - Role in Physical AI stack

2. Perception & Navigation (Isaac ROS)
   - VSLAM and sensor fusion concepts
   - Navigation fundamentals
   - Conceptual examples only

3. Path Planning with Nav2
   - Bipedal movement theory
   - Navigation pipeline overview
   - Constraints and challenges

Milestones:
- Draft all 3 chapters in Markdown
- Include conceptual diagrams/illustrations
- QA for clarity and Docusaurus compatibility
- Ensure minimal code snippets

Success Criteria:
- Chapters complete and conceptually clear
- Prepares students for Module 4
- Constraints satisfied (conceptual focus, minimal code)

Constraints:
- Conceptual focus only
- Minimal illustrative code
- Docusaurus Markdown compatible

Not Building:
- Full installation/setup instructions
- Full implementation examples
- Sim-to-real transfer
```

## Response Summary

Successfully completed the planning phase for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™). The planning included:

1. **Implementation Plan (plan.md)** - Detailed technical approach with constitution checks and project structure.

2. **Research (research.md)** - Comprehensive research on Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, VSLAM, sensor fusion, and Nav2 with rationale for technology choices.

3. **Data Model (data-model.md)** - Key entities and concepts for the module including Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, VSLAM, Nav2, and Humanoid Navigation.

4. **Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md)** - Conceptual overview with learning objectives and key concepts for each chapter.

5. **Contracts Directory** - Created for completeness (no actual API contracts needed for documentation).

All planning artifacts align with the original requirements of conceptual focus, minimal code, and Docusaurus compatibility. The constitution checks have been validated and all planning phase requirements have been satisfied. The module is ready for task generation and implementation.
