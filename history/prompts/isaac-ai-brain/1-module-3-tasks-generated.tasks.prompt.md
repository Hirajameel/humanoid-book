# Module 3 Tasks Generated - AI-Robot Brain

## Original Prompt

```
Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Purpose:
Define actionable tasks for implementing Module 3 content in Docusaurus, keeping conceptual focus and minimal code.

Tasks:

1. Chapter 1: Isaac Sim Overview
   - Write Markdown explaining photorealistic simulation and synthetic data
   - Highlight role of Isaac Sim in Physical AI stack
   - Include diagrams or conceptual illustrations

2. Chapter 2: Perception & Navigation (Isaac ROS)
   - Explain VSLAM and sensor fusion concepts
   - Describe navigation fundamentals for humanoid robots
   - Include conceptual examples only, no full code

3. Chapter 3: Path Planning with Nav2
   - Describe theory of bipedal movement and navigation pipeline
   - Explain challenges and constraints
   - Include minimal conceptual examples

4. QA & Review
   - Proofread content for clarity and technical accuracy
   - Validate minimal code examples
   - Ensure Docusaurus-ready Markdown
   - Confirm logical flow for Module 4 readiness

Constraints:
- Conceptual focus only
- Minimal illustrative code
- Markdown compatible with Docusaurus

Success Criteria:
- Chapters complete and clear
- Conceptual examples illustrate key points
- Prepares students for Module 4
- All constraints satisfied
```

## Response Summary

Successfully generated comprehensive task list for Module 3 implementation with the following structure:

1. **Setup Phase**: 4 tasks for initializing project structure and navigation
2. **Foundational Phase**: 4 tasks for research and terminology definition
3. **User Story 1 (Chapter 1)**: 10 tasks for Isaac Sim Overview content
4. **User Story 2 (Chapter 2)**: 11 tasks for Isaac ROS perception and navigation content
5. **User Story 3 (Chapter 3)**: 11 tasks for Nav2 path planning content
6. **Polish Phase**: 14 tasks for QA, review, and integration
7. **Constitution Compliance**: 6 tasks for ensuring project standards

Total of 60+ tasks organized with proper format (checkboxes, IDs, story labels, file paths). The tasks follow user story-based organization enabling independent implementation and testing. All constraints are satisfied: conceptual focus, minimal code, and Docusaurus compatibility. The task list includes proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities as specified.
