# Prompt History Record: Create Tasks for Digital Twin Module

## Outcome
Successfully created tasks.md file for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) in the digital-twin-sim directory.

## Evaluation
The tasks.md file was created following the required format with:
- Proper task organization by user stories (US1, US2, US3)
- Sequential task numbering with checkboxes
- Phase-based structure (Setup, Foundational, User Stories, Polish)
- Clear file paths and descriptions
- Parallel execution opportunities marked with [P]
- Dependencies and implementation strategy documented

## Prompt Text
Purpose:
Define actionable tasks for creating Module 2 content in Docusaurus.

Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Tasks:
1. Chapter 1: Digital Twins – Concept, value, Gazebo vs Unity
2. Chapter 2: Physics Simulation – Gravity, collisions, dynamics
3. Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation – LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs, Unity visualization
4. QA: Proofread, minimal code, Docusaurus-ready, prepare for Module 3

Constraints:
- Conceptual focus only
- Minimal illustrative code
- Markdown compatible

Success Criteria:
- Chapters clear and complete
- Prepares for Module 3
- Constraints satisfied

## Response Text
Created comprehensive tasks.md file with 56 specific, actionable tasks organized across 6 phases. Tasks are properly formatted with checkboxes, sequential IDs, user story labels where appropriate, and parallel execution markers. The file includes setup tasks, foundational tasks, and three user story phases corresponding to the three chapters, followed by polish and cross-cutting concerns.
