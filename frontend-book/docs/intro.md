# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** - a comprehensive resource exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical robotics.

## About This Book

This book is designed to provide a deep understanding of how AI systems interact with physical robots, with a focus on humanoid robotics. Each module builds upon the previous one, taking you from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations.

The book features:
- **Conceptual Understanding**: Focus on core principles and architectural patterns
- **Practical Applications**: Real-world examples and implementation patterns
- **Interactive Learning**: Embedded RAG chatbot for answering questions based on book content
- **Modular Design**: Independent modules that can be studied in sequence or individually

## Current Module: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

In **Module 1**, we explore ROS 2 as the middleware connecting AI software to humanoid robot hardware:

- **Chapter 1**: Understand ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system and its role in Physical AI
- **Chapter 2**: Master the ROS 2 communication model (nodes, topics, services, actions)
- **Chapter 3**: Learn how to bridge software to the robot body using rclpy and URDF

## Getting Started
