# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This module introduces ROS 2 as the middleware that connects AI software to humanoid robot hardware.

## Overview

This module provides a conceptual understanding of ROS 2 and its role in connecting AI systems to physical robots. It's designed for AI and robotics students with Python basics who are new to ROS 2.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain how ROS 2 functions as middleware connecting AI software to robot hardware
- Describe the fundamental ROS 2 communication patterns (nodes, topics, services, actions)
- Understand how data flows between sensors, AI, and actuators in a humanoid robot system
- Explain the role of rclpy in connecting Python-based AI agents to ROS 2
- Understand the purpose of URDF in defining a robot's physical structure
